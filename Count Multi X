"""
In our function, we split the first input string using the second input string. What this does is cut the first string into an array of smaller substrings containing the parts not equal to our second parameter x. For example, when splitting "mississippi" with the string "iss", the resulting array will be [“m”, “”, “ippi”]. This includes the characters before "iss" was found, the empty space between the two instances of "iss" and the characters after the last"iss". Be careful! In order to get the correct result we need to return one less than the total number of split sections — in this example, "iss" was in the string twice, resulting in 3 sections. So we should return 3 - 1.
